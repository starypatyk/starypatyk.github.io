I am Dariusz Olszewski - a software developer.

On this site - mostly intended for fellow programmers - I would like to share some of my (not so serious) thoughts on software development.

The site has been created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.
